# The heck is this?
as the description suggests. its a product spawning from a single line of message in a certain discord chat. As for what all the buttons do:
- THIGHS!: adds 1 to the frame count. As in, this increases the number of times thighs have appeared in the episode.
- fuck go back: if you've pressed THIGHS! one too many times, this helps you undo that. 
- Reset: resets the frame count to 0.
- FYI The number is locally saved in your browser storage.

# How to use
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine. 
- Open the counter.html file in your web browser. Just double click on the file, windows will do the rest for you.
